5. **Perfectionism** - Launch before you're ready, iterate based on feedback
6. **Ignoring finances** - Track expenses, set aside taxes, know your numbers
7. **Working in isolation** - Join communities, find mentors, build network
8. **Not specializing** - Become known for solving specific problems
9. **Overpromising** - Set realistic expectations, under-promise and over-deliver

## Final Thoughts

Building an AI consulting business is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on:

1. **Continuous Learning** - AI evolves rapidly; stay curious
2. **Client Success** - Your reputation is everything
3. **Consistent Action** - Small daily steps compound
4. **Authentic Relationships** - People buy from people they trust
5. **Value Creation** - Always ask "How can I help?"

Remember: You don't need to be the world's leading AI expert. You need to know more than your clients and be able to translate technical concepts into business value.

**Start today. Take imperfect action. Adjust as you go.**

Good luck! 🚀
